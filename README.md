ML Project - Bengaluru House Price Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India, based on various factors such as location, size, and amenities. The analysis and model building are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview

The notebook processes a dataset of house prices in Bengaluru and uses machine learning techniques to create a predictive model. The steps include:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Building and evaluating regression models.

Fine-tuning models using GridSearchCV.

Dataset

File: bengaluru_house_prices.csv

Description: The dataset contains details about house prices, including attributes such as location, size, total square feet, bath, and price.

Source: Kaggle.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical operations

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

Steps to Run

Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Install the required dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure the dataset (bengaluru_house_prices.csv) is in the working directory.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook ML_Project_CodeBasic.ipynb

Execute the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis and modeling.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations of price trends, correlations, and outlier detection.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.

Converting categorical data into numerical format.

Feature scaling.

Modeling:

Multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Trees.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Evaluation:

Metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Future Improvements

Incorporate additional features, such as proximity to landmarks or public transportation.

Use ensemble models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for better predictions.

Deploy the model using Flask or a similar framework.

Create a user interface for live predictions.
